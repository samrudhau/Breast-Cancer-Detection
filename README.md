# Breast-Cancer-Detection
The goal of the project is to develop and evaluate a TensorFlow model for breast cancer categorization to improve the accuracy of breast tumor identification and classification as benign or malignant. 
The project aims to contribute to the existing knowledge in the field and provide a straightforward approach that reduces false positive and false negative ratios while increasing classification accuracy.
